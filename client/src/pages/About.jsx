        This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application with
        authentication. It allows users to sign up, log in, and log out, and
        provides access to protected routes only for authenticated users.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>
        The front-end of the application is built with React and uses React
        Router for client-side routing. The back-end is built with Node.js and
        Express, and uses MongoDB as the database. Authentication is implemented
        using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>
        The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog
        posts. Users can also like posts and view the total number of likes for
        each post.
